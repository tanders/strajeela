* strajeela

This software is intended to be a better version of Strasheela at some stage. Anyway, at the moment this is just a very early version, not quite ready to be used yet.  

Once you downloaded the source, you could check out at the [[./doc/reference/index.html][reference documentation]] what is there so far (not much yet). 
(Unfortunately, Github makes it rather challenging to show automatically generated HTML files.)
